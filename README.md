Font Controller Lab

#Introduction

Problem:
The problem in this lab was to create a font controller that would display a screen of ASCII characters and allow the user to change each character on the screen using an array of switches and a button on the Atlys boards we are using.  

Solution:
In order to solve this, I was provided several modules but had to connect them inside of a `char_gen` module.
